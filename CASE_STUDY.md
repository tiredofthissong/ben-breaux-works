# Case Study: Public Sector Program Revamp

**Problem:**  
A state mental health program lacked measurable KPIs and clear adoption metrics. Service utilization was inconsistent, and training completion rates were low.

**Steps:**  
- Designed dashboards in SQL and Tableau to track usage and satisfaction.  
- Partnered with program leaders to align success metrics.  
- Delivered enablement sessions for staff and executive sponsors.  
- Applied ArcGIS visualizations for geographic coverage analysis.  

**Tools:**  
SQL, Tableau, ArcGIS, Excel  

**Outcome:**  
- Patient service volume increased by 65%  
- Staff training completion rose from 62% → 91%  
- Satisfaction scores improved from 3.6 → 4.5  
- Average case conference speed reduced from 14 days → 7 days
